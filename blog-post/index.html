        <h2>''A Power to Great for A NewBorn''</h2>
        <p>
           Broly’s power was terrifying long before he ever 
           became the Legendary Super Saiyan. Even as an infant, 
           his energy level was so overwhelming that it shocked Saiyan elites 
           and frightened King Vegeta himself. No newborn 
           should have had that kind of raw force—Broly’s aura flared 
           like a monster waiting to awaken. His uncontrolled power created 
           unease among the Saiyan royal family, who feared what 
           he might grow into, and even other warriors 
           sensed something unnatural about him. From the moment he was born, 
           Broly wasn’t seen as a child… he was seen as a future threat, 
           a being whose potential could one day surpass the entire Saiyan race.
