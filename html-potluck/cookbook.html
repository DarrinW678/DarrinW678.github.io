            <li>2 ½ cups (300 g) all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ cup (112 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup (170 g) pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>½ cup (100 g) light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>¼ cup (55 g) heavy cream plus more for brushing on the tops</li>
            <li>2 – 2 ½ cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>4-5 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 
                baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, 
                and ground ginger.</li>
        <li>Add the cold butter cubes and cut into the mixture 
            using a pastry cutter or two butter knives until 
            the largest pieces are the size of peas; set aside</li>
        <li>In a separate smaller bowl, 
            whisk together the pumpkin,
            brown sugar, egg, and heavy cream until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and stir
             until just combined. 
            The dough will be very wet and sticky.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface, 
            sprinkle some flour on top, and form an 8-inch (20 cm) 
            disc using floured hands. Cut the scones using a sharp knife 
            into 8 equal wedges, then carefully transfer them 
            to a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), or 180°C
            if using a fan oven. While the oven preheats,
            chill the scones in the fridge. Remove from the fridge 
            then brush with a little heavy cream
            before baking in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes,
            or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean
            and the bottom is just lightly golden.</li>
            <li>While the scones bake, prepare the glaze by whisking
                together 2 cups of the powdered
                sugar and heavy cream until smooth and spreadable.</li>
                <li>Allow the scones to cool completely
                     before spooning and spreading the glaze 
                     over the top of each scone.</li>
                     <li>To the remaining glaze in the bowl, 
                        whisk in the pumpkin puree and cinnamon until smooth.
                        If the icing is too thin, 
                        add a sprinkle of powdered sugar
                        until it is the desired consistency.</li>
                        <li>Drizzle or pipe the pumpkin 
                            glaze over the scones once the first layer
                             has set slightly, about 10 minutes.</li>
