            <b>Crown shyness</b>
            (also<i> also canopy disengagment,<sup>[1]</sup>canopy shyness,
                <sup>[2]</sup>or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>)
            </i>
             is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
             in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
              forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
              <sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>
              The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
              but also occurs between trees of different species.
              <sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>
              There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive
               behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of
                leaf-eating insect larvae.
